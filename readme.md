# SAM and Mithril in TypeScript boilerplate sample app

Features ultra-small dependencies. 

- [Mithril](http://mithril.js.org/) is 8kb gzipped and has a good fast virtualdom implementation as well as a request library. 
- Hand-built low-level [SAM architecture](http://sam.js.org/) in TypeScript keeps things organized and easy to write. 
- A small css library combining [Basscss](http://basscss.com/) and [lotus](http://goatslacker.github.io/lotus.css/) gives you very lightweight (4kb gzipped) declarative styling utility classes.
- Drastically reduced set of fontawesome icons weighs in less than 10k.

`npm install`
`webpack`

I use node `htttp-server` for development. Though it doesn't do gzip compression.
