# SAM and Mithril in TypeScript boilerplate sample app

Features ultra-small dependencies. 

- Mithril is 8kb gzipped and has a good fast virtualdom implementation as well as a request library. 
- Hand-built low-level SAM architecture in TypeScript Interfaces keeps things organized and easy to write. 
- A small css library combining [Basscss](http://basscss.com/) and [lotus](http://goatslacker.github.io/lotus.css/) gives me very lightweight declarative styling utilities.
- Drastically reduced set of fontawesome icons weighs in at 10k.

`npm install`

`webpack`

I use node `htttp-server` for development. Though it doesn't do gzip compression.
